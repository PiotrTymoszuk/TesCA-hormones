abstract = {The stem cell factor (SCF) is a cytokine that specifically binds the tyrosine kinase receptor c-KIT. The SCF/c-KIT interaction leads to receptor dimerization, activation of kinase activity and initiation of several signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration in several tissues. The activity of SCF/c-KIT system is linked with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), the Src, the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), the phospholipase-C (PLC-$\gamma$) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Moreover, it has been reported that cancer cases display an overactivation of c-KIT due to the presence of gain-of-function mutations or receptor overexpression, which renders c-KIT a tempting target for cancer treatment. In the case of male cancers the most documented activated pathways are the PI3-K and Src, both enhancing abnormal cell proliferation. It is also known that the Src activity in prostate cancer cases depends on the presence of tr-KIT, the cytoplasmic truncated variant of c-KIT that is specifically expressed in tumour tissues and, thus, a very interesting target for drug development. The present review provides an overview of the signalling pathways activated by SCF/c-KIT and discusses the potential application of c-KIT inhibitors for treatment of testicular and prostatic cancers.},

abstract = {Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) comprises 80%–85% of lung cancer cases. EGFR is involved in several cancer developments, including NSCLC. The EGFR pathway regulates the Bax/Bcl-2 cascade in NSCLC. Increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fundamental tumor progression has guided the development of numerous antitumor drugs. The development and improvement of rationally planned inhibitors and agents targeting particular cellular and biological pathways in cancer have been signified as a most important paradigm shift in the strategy to treat and manage lung cancer. Newer approaches and novel chemotherapeutic agents are required to accompany present cancer therapies for improving efficiency. Using natural products as a drug with an effective delivery system may benefit therapeutics. Naturally originated compounds such as phytochemicals provide crucial sources for novel agents/drugs and resources for tumor therapy. Applying the small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs)/phytochemicals has led to potent preclinical discoveries in various human tumor preclinical models, including lung cancer. In this review, we summarize recent information on the molecular mechanisms of the Bax/Bcl-2 cascade and EGFR pathway in NSCLC and target them for therapeutic implications. We further described the therapeutic potential of Bax/Bcl-2/EGFR SMIs, mainly those with more potent and selectivity, including gefitinib, EGCG, ABT-737, thymoquinone, quercetin, and venetoclax. In addition, we explained the targeting EGFR pathway and ongoing in vitro and in vivo and clinical investigations in NSCLC. Exploration of such inhibitors facilitates the future treatment and management of NSCLC.},

abstract = {When properly employed, targeted therapies are effective cancer treatments. However, the development of such therapies requires the identification of targetable drivers of cancer development and metastasis. The expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are increased in many human cancers, and experimental evidence indicates that aberrant YAP or TAZ activation drives tumor formation and metastasis. Although these findings make YAP and TAZ appealing therapeutic targets, both have important functions in adult tissues, so directly targeting them could cause adverse effects. The identification of pathways active in cancer cells and required for YAP/TAZ activity could provide a way to inhibit YAP and TAZ. Here, we show that SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) is an important driver of YAP/TAZ activity in human breast cancer and melanoma cells. SRC activation increased YAP/TAZ activity and the expression of YAP/TAZ-regulated genes. In contrast, SRC inhibition or knockdown repressed both YAP/TAZ activity and the expression of YAP/TAZ-regulated genes. We also show that SRC increases the activity of YAP and TAZ by repressing large tumor suppressor homolog (LATS), and we identify the GTPase-activating protein GIT ArfGAP 1 (GIT1) as an SRC effector that regulates both YAP and TAZ. Importantly, we demonstrate that SRC-mediated YAP/TAZ activity promotes tumor growth and enhances metastasis and that SRC-dependent tumor progression depends, at least in part, on YAP and TAZ. Our findings suggest that therapies targeting SRC could help manage some YAP/TAZ-dependent cancers.},

abstract = {The advancement of new therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, has improved the survival of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the last decade. Some NSCLC patients still do not benefit from therapies or encounter progressive disease during the course of treatment because they have intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance, or lack a targetable driver mutation. More investigations on the molecular biology of NSCLC are needed to find useful biomarkers for current therapies and to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein that interacts with cell surface growth factor receptors and the intracellular signaling pathway to maintain cell survival tumorigenesis in NSCLC. The Yes-associated protein (YAP) is one of the main effectors of the Hippo pathway and has been identified as a promoter of drug resistance, cancer progression, and metastasis in NSCLC. Here, we review studies that have investigated the activation of YAP as mediated by Src kinases and demonstrate that Src regulates YAP through three main mechanisms: (1) direct phosphorylation; (2) the activation of pathways repressing Hippo kinases; and (3) Hippo-independent mechanisms. Further work should focus on the efficacy of Src inhibitors in inhibiting YAP activity in NSCLC. In addition, future efforts toward developing potentially reasonable combinations of therapy targeting the Src–YAP axis using other therapies, including targeted therapies and/or immunotherapies, are warranted.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cancer Immunotherapy has recently emerged as a promising and effective modality to treat different malignancies. Antigenic profiling of cancer tissues and determination of any pre-existing immune responses to cancer antigens may help predict responses to immune intervention in cancer. NY-ESO-1, a cancer testis antigen is the most immunogenic antigen to date. The promise of NY-ESO-1 as a candidate for specific immune recognition of cancer comes from its restricted expression in normal adult tissue but frequent occurrence in multiple tumors including melanoma and carcinomas of lung, esophageal, liver, gastric, prostrate, ovarian, and bladder. Main body: This review summarizes current knowledge of NY-ESO-1 as efficient biomarker and target of immunotherapy. It also addresses limitations and challenges preventing a robust immune response to NY-ESO-1 expressing cancers, and describes pre-clinical and clinical observations relevant to NY-ESO-1 immunity, holding potential therapeutic relevance for cancer treatment. Conclusion: NY-ESO-1 induces strong immune responses in cancer patients but has limited objective clinical responses to NY-ESO-1 expressing tumors due to effect of competitive negative signaling from immune-checkpoints and immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. We propose that combination therapy to increase the efficacy of NY-ESO-1 specific immunotherapeutic interventions should be explored to unleash the immune response against NY-ESO-1 expressing tumors.},

abstract = {Cancer-testis (CT) genes represent the similarity between the processes of spermatogenesis and tumorigenesis. It is possible that their selective expression pattern can help identify driver genes in cancer. In this study, we integrate transcriptomics data from multiple databases and systematically identify 876 new CT genes in 19 cancer types. We explore their relationship with testis-specific regulatory elements. We propose that extremely highly expressed CT genes (EECTGs) are potential drivers activated through epigenetic mechanisms. We find mutually exclusive associations between EECTGs and somatic mutations in mutated genes, such as PIK3CA in breast cancer. We also provide evidence that promoter demethylation and close non-coding RNAs (namely, CT-ncRNAs) may be two mechanisms to reactivate EECTG gene expression. We show that the meiosis-related EECTG (MEIOB) and its nearby CT-ncRNA have a role in tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings provide methods for identifying epigenetic-driver genes of cancer, which could serve as targets of future cancer therapies. Genes normally expressed in the testis but aberrantly expressed in cancer are termed cancer testis antigens. In this study, the authors catalogue the expression of these genes in 19 different cancer types and correlate expression with some somatically mutated oncogenes.},

abstract = {Preoperative homeostasis of sex hormones in testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) patients is scarcely characterized. We aimed to explore regulation of sex hormones and their implications for histopathological parameters and prognosis in TGCT using a data-driven explorative approach. Pre-surgery serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) and prolactin were measured in a retrospective multicenter TGCT cohort (n = 518). Clusters of patients were defined by latent class analysis. Clinical, pathologic and survival parameters were compared between the clusters by statistical hypothesis testing, Random Forest modeling and Peto-Peto test. Cancer tissue expression of sex hormone-related genes was explored in the publicly available TCGA cohort (n = 149). We included 354 patients with pure seminoma and 164 patients with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT), with a median age of 36 years. Three hormonal clusters were defined: ‘neutral' (n = 228) with normal sex hormone homeostasis, ‘testicle' (n = 91) with elevated T and E2, low pituitary hormones, and finally ‘pituitary' subset (n = 103) with increased FSH and LH paralleled by low-to-normal levels of the gonadal hormones. Relapse-free survival in the hormonal subsets was comparable (p = 0.64). Cancer tissue expression of luteinizing hormone- and follicle-stimulating hormone-coding genes was significantly higher in seminomas, while genes of T and E2 biosynthesis enzymes were strongly upregulated in NSGCT. Substantial percentages of TGCT patients are at increased risk of sex hormone dysfunction at primary diagnosis before orchiectomy. TGCT may directly influence systemic hormonal homeostasis by in-situ synthesis of sex hormones.},

abstract = {Adult male germ cell tumors (GCTs) comprise distinct groups: seminomas and nonseminomas, which include pluripotent embryonal carcinomas as well as other histologic subtypes exhibiting various stages of differentiation. Almost all GCTs show 12p gain, but the target genes have not been clearly defined. To identify 12p target genes, we examined Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) U133A+B microarray (∼ 83% coverage of 12p genes) expression profiles of 17 seminomas, 84 nonseminoma GCTs, and 5 normal testis samples. Seventy-three genes on 12p were significantly overexpressed, including GLUT3 and REA (overexpressed in all GCTs) and CCND2 and FLJ22028 (overexpressed in all GCTs, except choriocarcinomas). We characterized a 200-kb gene cluster at 12p13.31 that exhibited coordinated overexpression in embryonal carcinomas and seminomas, which included the known stem cell genes NANOG, STELLA, and GDF3 and two previously uncharacterized genes. A search for other coordinately regulated genomic clusters of stem cell genes did not reveal any genomic regions similar to that at 12p13.31. Comparison of embryonal carcinoma with seminomas revealed relative overexpression of several stem cell-associated genes in embryonal carcinoma, including several core "stemness" genes (EBAF, TDGF1, and SOX2) and several downstream targets of WNT, NODAL, and FGF signaling (FGF4, NODAL, and ZFP42). Our results indicate that 12p gain is a functionally relevant change leading to activation of proliferation and reestablishment/maintenance of stem cell function through activation of key stem cell genes. Furthermore, the differential expression of core stem cell genes may explain the differences in pluripotency between embryonal carcinomas and seminomas. {\textcopyright}2006 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Objectives: To identify differentially expressed genes between relapsed and non-relapsed clinical stage I testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs). Materials and Methods: We reviewed patients with clinical stage I non-seminoma and seminoma from an institutional database (2000–2012) who were managed by active surveillance. Patients with non-relapsed non-seminoma and non-relapsed seminoma were defined as being relapse-free after 2 and 3 years of surveillance, respectively. RNA extraction and gene expression analysis was performed on archival primary tumour samples and gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted in order to identify differentiating biological pathways. Results: A total of 57 patients (relapsed non-seminoma, n = 12; relapsed seminoma, n =15; non-relapsed non-seminoma, n = 15; non-relapsed seminoma, n = 15) were identified, with a median (range) relapse time of 5.6 (2.5–18.1) and 19.3 (4.7–65.3) months in the relapsed non-seminoma and relapsed seminoma cohorts, respectively. A total of 1 039 differentially expressed genes were identified that separated relapsed and non-relapsed groups. In patients with relapse, GSEA revealed enrichment in pathways associated with differentiation, such as skeletal development (i.e. FGFR1, BMP4, GLI2, SPARC, COL2A1), tissue (i.e. BMP4, SPARC, COL13A1) and bone remodelling (i.e. CARTPT, GLI2, MGP). A discriminative gene expression profile between relapsed and non-relapsed cases was discovered when combining non-seminoma and seminoma samples using 10- and 30-probe signatures; however, this profile was not observed in the seminoma and non-seminoma cohorts individually. Conclusion: A discriminating signature for relapsed disease was identified for clinical stage I TGCT that we were not able to identify by histology alone. Further validation is required to determine if this signature provides independent prognostic information to standard pathological risk factors.},

Previous studies have mapped AR targets and identified some candidates which may contribute to cancer progression, but did not characterize AR biology in an integrated manner. In this study, we took an interdisciplinary approach, integrating detailed genomic studies with metabolomic profiling and identify an anabolic transcriptional network involving AR as the core regulator. Restricting flux through anabolic pathways is an attractive approach to deprive tumours of the building blocks needed to sustain tumour growth. Therefore, we searched for targets of the AR that may contribute to these anabolic processes and could be amenable to therapeutic intervention by virtue of differential expression in prostate tumours. This highlighted calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, which we show is overexpressed in prostate cancer and regulates cancer cell growth via its unexpected role as a hormone-dependent modulator of anabolic metabolism. In conclusion, it is possible to progress from transcriptional studies to a promising therapeutic target by taking an unbiased interdisciplinary approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {As one of the most successful cancer therapeutic targets, estrogen receptor-a (ER/ESR1) has been extensively studied over the past few decades. Sequencing technological advances have enabled genome-wide analysis of ER action. However, comparison of individual studies is limited by different experimental designs, and few meta-analyses are available. Here, we established the EstroGene database through unified processing of data from 246 experiments including 136 transcriptomic, cistromic, and epigenetic datasets focusing on estradiol (E2)-triggered ER activation across 19 breast cancer cell lines. A user-friendly browser (https://estrogene.org/) was generated for multiomic data visualization involving gene inquiry under user-defined experimental conditions and statistical thresholds. Notably, annotation of metadata associated with public datasets revealed a considerable lack of experimental details. Comparison of independent RNA-seq or ER ChIP-seq data with the same design showed large variability and only strong effects could be consistently detected. Temporal estrogen response metasignatures were defined, and the association of E2 response rate with temporal transcriptional factors, chromatin accessibility, and heterogeneity of ER expression was evaluated. Unexpectedly, harmonizing 146 E2-induced transcriptomic datasets uncovered a subset of genes harboring bidirectional E2 regulation, which was linked to unique transcriptional factors and highly associated with immune surveillance in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the context dependent E2 response programs were characterized in MCF7 and T47D cell lines, the two most frequently used models in the EstroGene database. Collectively, the EstroGene database provides an informative and practical resource to the cancer research community to uniformly evaluate key reproducible features of ER regulomes and unravels modes of ER signaling. Significance: A resource database integrating 246 publicly available ER profiling datasets facilitates meta-analyses and identifies estrogen response temporal signatures, a bidirectional program, and model-specific biases.},

abstract = {Translocator protein (TSPO) is a key member of the mitochondrial cholesterol transport complex in steroidogenic tissues. To assess the function of TSPO, we generated two lines of Cre-mediated Tspo conditional knockout (cKO) mice. First, gonadal somatic celltargeting Amhr2-Cre mice were crossed with Tspo-floxed mice to obtain F1 Tspo Amhr2 cKO mice (Tspo<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Amhr2-Cre<sup>/+</sup>). The unexpected Mendelian ratio of 4.4% cKO mice was confirmed by genotyping of 12.5-day-postcoitum (dpc) embryos. As Amhr2-Cre is expressed in gonads at 12.5 dpc, these findings suggest preimplantation selection of embryos. Analysis of expression databases revealed elevated levels of Amhr2 in two- and eight-cell zygotes, suggesting ectopic Tspo silencing before the morula stage and demonstrating elevated embryonic lethality and involvement of TSPO in embryonic development. To circumvent this issue, steroidogenic cell-targeting Nr5a1-Cre mice were crossed with Tspofloxed mice. The resulting Tspo<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nr5a1-Cre<sup>/+</sup> mice were born at a normal Mendelian ratio. Nr5a1-driven Tspo cKO mice exhibited highly reduced Tspo levels in adrenal cortex and gonads. Treatment of mice with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) resulted in increased circulating testosterone levels despite extensive lipid droplet depletion. In contrast, Nr5a1-driven Tspo cKO mice lost their ability to form corticosterone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Important for ACTH-dependent steroidogenesis, Mc2r, Stard1, and Cypa11a1 levels were unaffected, whereas Scarb1 levels were increased and accumulation of lipid droplets was observed, indicative of a blockade of cholesterol utilization for steroidogenesis. TSPO expression in the adrenal medulla and increased epinephrine production were also observed. In conclusion, TSPO was found necessary for preimplantation embryo development and ACTH-stimulated steroid biosynthesis.},

Cancer cell-line (CCL) profiling of small-molecule sensitivity has emerged as an unbiased method to assess the relationships between genetic or cellular features of CCLs and small-molecule response. Here, we developed annotated cluster multidimensional enrichment analysis to explore the associations between groups of small molecules and groups of CCLs in a new, quantitative sensitivity dataset. This analysis reveals insights into small-molecule mechanisms of action, and genomic features that associate with CCL response to small-molecule treatment. We are able to recapitulate known relationships between FDA-approved therapies and cancer dependencies and to uncover new relationships, including for KRAS-mutant cancers and neuroblastoma. To enable the cancer community to explore these data, and to generate novel hypotheses, we created an updated version of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (CTRP v2).},

The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database (www.cancerRxgene.org) is the largest public resource for information on drug sensitivity in cancer cells and molecular markers of drug response. Data are freely available without restriction. GDSC currently contains drug sensitivity data for almost 75000 experiments, describing response to 138 anticancer drugs across almost 700 cancer cell lines. To identify molecular markers of drug response, cell line drug sensitivity data are integrated with large genomic datasets obtained from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, including information on somatic mutations in cancer genes, gene amplification and deletion, tissue type and tran-scriptional data. Analysis of GDSC data is through a web portal focused on identifying molecular bio-markers of drug sensitivity based on queries of specific anticancer drugs or cancer genes. Graphical representations of the data are used throughout with links to related resources and all datasets are fully downloadable.

Here, to facilitate the development and adoption of this methodology we have created an R package called pRRophetic. This also extends the previously described pipeline, allowing prediction of clinical drug response for many cancer drugs in a user-friendly R environment. We have developed several other important use cases; as an example, we have shown that prediction of bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma may be improved by training models on a large set of neoplastic hematological cell lines. We have also shown that the package facilitates model development and prediction using several different classes of data.},

In parallel, we have developed a bioinformatic approach to predict the in silico "matrisome" defined as the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors. We report the characterization of the extracellular matrices of murine lung and colon, each comprising more than 100 ECM proteins and each presenting a characteristic signature. Moreover, using human tumor xenografts in mice, we show that both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the production of the tumor matrix and that tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in both the tumor- and the stroma-derived ECM components. The strategy we describe and illustrate here can be broadly applied and, to facilitate application of these methods by others, we provide resources including laboratory protocols, inventories of ECM domains and proteins, and instructions for bioinformatically deriving the human and mouse matrisome. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The regulatory relationship between transcription factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection of regulons created using the CollecTRI meta-resource containing signed TF–gene interactions for 1186 TFs. In this context, we introduce a workflow to integrate information from multiple resources and assign the sign of regulation to TF–gene interactions that could be applied to other comprehensive knowledge bases. We find that the signed CollecTRI-derived regulons outperform other public collections of regulatory interactions in accurately inferring changes in TF activities in perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we showcase the value of the regulons by examining TF activity profiles in three different cancer types and exploring TF activities at the level of single-cells. Overall, the CollecTRI-derived TF regulons enable the accurate and comprehensive estimation of TF activities and thereby help to interpret transcriptomics data.},

However, mapping gene expression to pathway components disregards the effect of post-translational modifications, and downstream signatures represent very specific experimental conditions. Here we present PROGENy, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway RespOnsive GENes. Unlike pathway mapping methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival. Collectively, these results show that PROGENy accurately infers pathway activity from gene expression in a wide range of conditions. Deregulation of signalling is responsible for many cancer phenotypes. Leveraging available perturbation data, here the authors assess large-scale pathway activity patterns based on consensus downstream readout genes, enabling accurate prediction of the effects of mutations and small molecules.},

Different penalization strategies are considered and compared in a theoretical analysis and an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. Based on the results, we propose a new method called hard-threshold K-means (HTK-means), which uses an 0 penalty to induce sparsity. HTK-means is a fast and competitive sparse clustering method which is easily interpretable, as is illustrated on several real data examples. In this context, new graphical displays are presented and used to gain further insight into the data sets.},

abstract = {Several measures have been proposed for comparing nonlinear projection methods but so far no comparisons have taken into account one of their most important properties, the trustworthiness of the resulting neighborhood or proximity relationships. One of the main uses of nonlinear mapping methods is to visualize multivariate data, and in such visualizations it is crucial that the visualized proximities can be trusted upon: If two data samples are close to each other on the display they should be close-by in the original space as well. A local measure of trustworthiness is proposed and it is shown for three data sets that neighborhood relationships visualized by the Self-Organizing Map and its variant, the Generative Topographic Mapping, are more trustworthy than visualizations produced by traditional multidimensional scaling based nonlinear projection methods.},

@article{Funder2019,
abstract = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of.05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of.10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of.20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of.30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r =.40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.},

abstract = { Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is frequently infiltrated by immune cells, a process which is governed by chemokines. CD8 +  T cells in the RCC tumor microenvironment (TME) may be exhausted which most likely influence therapy response and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate chemokine-driven T cell recruitment, T cell exhaustion in the RCC TME, as well as metabolic processes leading to their functional anergy in RCC. Eight publicly available bulk RCC transcriptome collectives (n=1819) and a single cell RNAseq dataset (n=12) were analyzed. Immunodeconvolution, semi-supervised clustering, gene set variation analysis and Monte Carlo-based modeling of metabolic reaction activity were employed. Among 28 chemokine genes available, CXCL9/10/11/CXCR3, CXCL13/CXCR5 and XCL1/XCR1 mRNA expression were significantly increased in RCC compared to normal kidney tissue and also strongly associated with tumor-infiltrating effector memory and central memory CD8 + T cells in all investigated collectives. M1 TAMs, T cells, NK cells as well as tumor cells were identified as the major sources of these chemokines, whereas T cells, B cells and dendritic cells were found to predominantly express the cognate receptors. The cluster of RCCs characterized by high chemokine expression and high CD8 + T cell infiltration displayed a strong activation of IFN/JAK/STAT signaling with elevated expression of multiple T cell exhaustion-associated transcripts. Chemokine high RCCs were characterized by metabolic reprogramming, in particular by downregulated OXPHOS and increased IDO1-mediated tryptophan degradation. None of the investigated chemokine genes was significantly associated with survival or response to immunotherapy. We propose a chemokine network that mediates CD8 + T cell recruitment and identify T cell exhaustion, altered energy metabolism and high IDO1 activity as key mechanisms of their suppression. Concomitant targeting of exhaustion pathways and metabolism may pose an effective approach to RCC therapy. },

abstract = {At the late 1940s, 17$\beta$-HSD1 was discovered as the first member of the 17$\beta$-HSD family with its gene cloned. The three-dimensional structure of human 17$\beta$-HSD1 is the first example of any human steroid converting enzyme. The human enzyme's structure and biological function have thus been studied extensively in the last two decades. In humans, the enzyme is expressed in placenta, ovary, endometrium and breast. The high activity of estrogen activation provides the basis of 17$\beta$-HSD1's implication in estrogen-dependent diseases, such as breast cancer, endometriosis and non-small cell lung carcinomas. Its dual function in estrogen activation and androgen inactivation has been revealed in molecular and breast cancer cell levels, significantly stimulating the proliferation of such cells. The enzyme's overexpression in breast cancer was demonstrated by clinical samples. Inhibition of human 17$\beta$-HSD1 led to xenograft tumor shrinkage. Unfortunately, through decades of studies, there is still no drug using the enzyme's inhibitors available. This is due to the difficulty to get rid of the estrogenic activity of its inhibitors, which are mostly estrogen analogues. New non-steroid inhibitors for the enzyme provide new hope for non-estrogenic inhibitors of the enzyme.},

abstract = {The pituitary gonadotrophins and testosterone are the main hormonal regulators of spermatogenesis, but estradiol is also known to play a role in the process. The hormonal responses in the testis are partially mediated by somatic Sertoli cells that provide nutritional and physical support for differentiating male germ cells. Hydroxysteroid (17b) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) is a steroidogenic enzyme that especially catalyzes the conversion of low potent 17keto-steroids to highly potent 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroids. In this study,we showthat Hsd17b1 is highly expressedinSertoli cells of fetal and newborn mice, and HSD17B1 knockout males present with disrupted spermatogenesis with major defects, particularly in the head shape of elongating spermatids. The cell-cell junctions between Sertoli cells and germ cells were disrupted in the HSD17B1 knockout mice. This resulted in complications in the orientation of elongating spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium, reduced sperm production, and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. We also showed that the Sertoli cell-expressed HSD17B1 participates in testicular steroid synthesis, evidenced by a compensatory up-regulation ofHSD17B3 inLeydig cells.These results revealed a novel role forHSD17B1inthe control of spermatogenesis and male fertility, and that Sertoli cells significantly contribute to steroid synthesis in the testis.},

abstract = {Sex steroid hormones such as estrogens and androgens are involved in the development and differentiation of the breast tissue. The activity and concentration of sex steroids is determined by the availability from the circulation, and on local conversion. This conversion is primarily mediated by aromatase, steroid sulfatase, and 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. In postmenopausal women, this is the primary source of estrogens in the breast. Up to 70-80% of all breast cancers express the estrogen receptor-a, responsible for promoting the growth of the tissue. Further, 60-80% express the androgen receptor, which has been shown to have tissue protective effects in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, and a more ambiguous response in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. In this review, we summarize the function and clinical relevance in cancer for 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1, which facilitates the reduction of estrone to estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone to androstendiol and dihydrotestosterone to 3a- and 3$\beta$-diol as well as 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 2 which mediates the oxidation of estradiol to estrone, testosterone to androstenedione and androstendiol to dehydroepiandrosterone. The expression of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 and 2 alone and in combination has been shown to predict patient outcome, and inhibition of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 has been proposed to be a prime candidate for inhibition in patients who develop aromatase inhibitor resistance or in combination with aromatase inhibitors as a first line treatment. Here we review the status of inhibitors against 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1. In addition, we review the involvement of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 4, 5, 7, and 14 in breast cancer.},

Some of these antigens are encoded by genes MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and BAGE, which are expressed in a large fraction of tumors of various histological types but are silent in normal adult tissues with the exception of testis. We report here the identification of the gene coding for MZ2-F, another antigen recognized by autologous CTL on MZ2-MEL cells. This gene, which was named GAGE-l, is not related to any presently known gene. It belongs to a family of genes that are expressed in a variety of tumors but not in normal tissues, except for the testis. Antigenic peptide YILPRPRRY, which is encoded by GAGE-l, is recognized by anti-MZ2-F CTL on class I molecule HLA-Cw6. The two genes of the GAGE family that code for this peptide, namely GAGE-1 and GAGE-2, are expressed in a significant proportion of melanomas (24%), sarcomas (25%), non-small cell lung cancers (19%), head and neck tumors (19%), and bladder tumors (12%). About 50% of melanoma patients carry on their tumor at least one of the presently defined antigens encoded by the MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE genes. {\textcopyright} 1995, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

In the era of immune-based cancer therapeutics, redirecting our immune cells to target these tumour-specific antigens has become even more relevant. Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are a class of antigens with an expression specific to the testis and cancer cells. CTAs have also been demonstrated to be expressed in a wide variety of cancers. Due to their frequency and specificity of expression in a multitude of cancers, CTAs have been particularly attractive as cancer-specific therapeutic targets. There is now a rapid expansion of CTAs being identified and many studies have been conducted to correlate CTA expression with cancer and therapy-resistant phenotypes. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of clinical trials involving using some of these CTAs as molecular targets in pharmacological and immune-targeted therapeutics for various cancers. This review will summarise the current knowledge of the biology of known CTAs in tumorigenesis and the regulation of CTA genes. CTAs as molecular targets and the therapeutic implications of these CTA-targeted anticancer strategies will also be discussed.},

TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale.

@article{Zhu2022,
abstract = {Purpose:There is an age-related decline in male testosterone production. It is therefore surprising that young men are evaluated for testosterone deficiency with the same cutoff of 300 ng/dL that was developed from samples of older men. Our aim is to describe normative total testosterone levels and age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels in men 20 to 44 years old.Materials and Methods:We analyzed the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which survey nationally representative samples of United States residents. Men 20 to 44 years old with testosterone levels were included. Men on hormonal medications, with a history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and with afternoon/evening laboratory values were excluded. We separated men into 5-year intervals and evaluated the testosterone levels of each age group, and for all men 20 to 44 years old. We used the American Urological Association definition of a "normal testosterone level"(the "middle tertile") to calculate age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels.Results:Our final analytic cohort contained 1,486 men. Age-specific middle tertile levels were 409-558 ng/dL (20-24 years old), 413-575 ng/dL (25-29 years old), 359-498 ng/dL (30-34 years old), 352-478 ng/dL (35-39 years old), and 350-473 ng/dL (40-44 years old). Age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels were 409, 413, 359, 352, and 350 ng/dL, respectively.Conclusions:Diagnosis of testosterone deficiency has traditionally been performed in an age-indiscriminate manner. However, young men have different testosterone reference ranges than older men. Accordingly, age-specific normative values and cutoffs should be integrated into the evaluation of young men presenting with testosterone deficiency.},

Commonly in the social and behavioral sciences and increasingly in epidemiologic research, multiple indicators are utilized as responses in lieu of an obvious single measure for an outcome of interest. In this article we study the concomitant latent class model for analyzing such multivariate categorical outcome data. We develop practical theory for reducing and identifying such models. We detail parameter and standard error fitting that parallels standard latent class methodology, thus supplementing the approach proposed by Dayton and Macready. We propose and study diagnostic strategies, exemplifying our methods using physical disability data from an ongoing gerontologic study. Throughout, the focus of our work is on applications for which a primary goal is to study the association between health or functioning and covariates. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

For survival data, the statistical methodology to assess such schemes consists mainly of a range of ad hoc approaches, and there is an alarming lack of commonly accepted standards in this field. We review these methods and develop measures of inaccuracy which may be calculated in a validation study in order to assess the usefulness of estimated patient-specific survival probabilities associated with a prognostic classification scheme. These measures are meaningful even when the estimated probabilities are misspecified, and asymptotically they are not affected by random censorship. In addition, they can be used to derive R2-type measures of explained residual variation. A breast cancer study will serve for illustration throughout the paper.},

Furthermore, we show that a modified version of this estimator is consistent even when censoring and event times are only conditionally independent given the covariates. The modified estimators are derived on the basis of regression models for the censoring distribution.

abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown thai the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of metabolic fluxes in biochemical networks is of major interest in systems biology. Several databases provide metabolic reconstructions for different organisms. Software to analyze flux distributions exists, among others for the proprietary MATLAB environment. Given the large user community for the R computing environment, a simple implementation of flux analysis in R appears desirable and will facilitate easy interaction with computational tools to handle gene expression data. We extended the R software package BiGGR, an implementation of metabolic flux analysis in R. BiGGR makes use of public metabolic reconstruction databases, and contains the BiGG database and the reconstruction of human metabolism Recon2 as Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) objects. Models can be assembled by querying the databases for pathways, genes or reactions of interest. Fluxes can then be estimated by maximization or minimization of an objective function using linear inverse modeling algorithms. Furthermore, BiGGR provides functionality to quantify the uncertainty in flux estimates by sampling the constrained multidimensional flux space. As a result, ensembles of possible flux configurations are constructed that agree with measured data within precision limits. BiGGR also features automatic visualization of selected parts of metabolic networks using hypergraphs, with hyperedge widths proportional to estimated flux values. BiGGR supports import and export of models encoded in SBML and is therefore interoperable with different modeling and analysis tools. As an application example, we calculated the flux distribution in healthy human brain using a model of central carbon metabolism. We introduce a new algorithm termed Least-squares with equalities and inequalities Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA) to predict flux changes from gene expression changes, for instance during disease. Our estimates of brain metabolic flux pattern with Lsei-FBA for Alzheimer's disease agree with independent measurements of cerebral metabolism in patients. This second version of BiGGR is available from Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

@article{Strobl2008,
abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data.

In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

@article{Tarca2009,
abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. Results: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

@article{Hanzelmann2013,
abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Wickham2019,
abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity and latent variables are now widely recognized as major sources of bias and variability in high-throughput experiments. The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects-when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the ComBat function and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

Finally, we used quanTIseq to show how kinase inhibitors modulate the immune contexture and to reveal immune-cell types that underlie differential patients' responses to checkpoint blockers.
